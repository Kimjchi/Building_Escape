## Instructions

The goal of this project was to play around with Unreal Engine and try the basic functionalities.
In this small level, you are stuck in a room. To open the door you need to stand on the corner of the room where the light is placed.
However, you are not fast enough to go out before the door closes. You should then place the cone and cube where the light is to hold the door open.
Hold right-click on your mouse within reach of the object to grab it.
